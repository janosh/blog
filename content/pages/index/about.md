I am a theoretical physicist at Cambridge University trying to solve [physics problems](/physics) with [machine learning](/ai).

I am a would-be but of course full-stack [web](./web) developer.

I enjoy photography. You can take a look at some of my shots [right here](/photography).

I'm head of IT for the German student-run non-profit initative [Studenten bilden Schüler](https://studenten-bilden-schueler.de/verein/bundesvorstand). We aim to contribute towards more equal educational opportunities for refugees and children from underprivileged families by offering free tutoring.

I decided to become a vegan in April 2014 mainly for ecological reasons. Never looked back. :)

I used to be a drummer in a band. Nowadays I still play for fun occasionally.
