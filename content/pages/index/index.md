I am a [theoretical physicist](/physics) turned [machine learner](/ml) (you know what I mean) at Cambridge University. I'm trying to discover new [functional materials](https://quora.com/What-are-the-functional-materials) that might help our transition to sustainability by enabling improved energy generation and storage devices. In my free time, I enjoy [web](/web) development.

I work for the German student-run non-profit initiative [Studenten bilden Sch√ºler](https://studenten-bilden-schueler.de/bundesvorstand). We aim to contribute to more equal educational opportunities by offering free private tutoring for refugees and children from underprivileged families.
