I am a [theoretical physicist](/physics) turned [machine learner](/ml) (you know what I mean) at Cambridge University. I'm trying to discover new [functional materials](https://quora.com/What-are-the-functional-materials) that might help our transition to sustainability by enabling improved energy generation and storage devices. In my free time, I enjoy [web development](/web).

I work for the German student-run non-profit initiative [Studenten bilden Schüler](https://studenten-bilden-schueler.de/bundesvorstand). We aim to contribute towards more equal educational opportunities for refugees and children from underprivileged families by offering free tutoring.
