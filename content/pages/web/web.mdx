I started learning web development in February 2018 when I moved to Barcelona for three months to participate in a JavaScript bootcamp at [Codeworks](https://codeworks.me). I had a great time, learned a lot and have been hooked on web technologies ever since. Below is a list of some recent projects and the technologies I enjoy using the most.
