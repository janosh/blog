A German student-run nonprofit initiative that I co-run. SbS has about 1000 active members providing free tuition to children from underprivileged families as well as - more recently - refugees in over 20 university towns all over Germany. Our goal is to thereby contribute to more equal educational opportunities for all disadvantaged members of society.

We used to have a really old-school [Joomla](https://joomla.org)-powered homepage. That's all in the past now, luckily. Instead, we now sport a shiny new [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) site, designed with [`styled-components`](https://styled-components.com), managed through [Contentful](https://contentful.com) and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com)'s blazing fast CDN. Can you believe that you get all that goodness for free nowadays! :)
