Web app with React + Redux [frontend](https://github.com/janosh/tutorific-frontend) and Koa + Mongoose [backend](https://github.com/janosh/tutorific-backend) that wasn't (yet, hopefully) launched but could provide a fully automated platform to connect children from underprivileged families struggling in school with university students willing to provide free tuition. Similar to how eBay or Craig's List connect buyers and sellers in a manner that doesn't require any manual oversight.

Inspired by [Studenten bilden Sch√ºler](https://studenten-bilden-schueler.de).
