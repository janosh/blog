This post is a guide on how to use the [Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) transition kernel](https://tensorflow.org/probability/api_docs/python/tfp/mcmc/HamiltonianMonteCarlo) provided by [TensorFlow Probability](https://tensorflow.org/probability) to train Bayesian neural networks (BNN) by sampling from their posterior distribution. If you haven't heard of HMC before, check out this [short introduction](/blog/hmc-intro). Or, if you just want the 30-second elevator pitch: HMC is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior of simpler MCMC methods such as Metropolis-Hastings or Gibbs sampling by using Hamilton's equations of classical mechanics to take a series of first-order-gradient-informed steps through an auxiliary phase space which can be projected down onto the probability density you care about. This allows it to massively speed up mixing (i.e. generating a Markov chain of less correlated samples) and converge on even high-dimensional target distributions (although -- here's the upfront disclaimer -- perhaps not the many tens of thousands to several million parameters of modern neural networks which result in a posterior distribution of equal dimensionality).

> The code in this guide was written in [TensorFlow (TF) v2.1](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow) and [TensorFlow Probability (TFP) v0.9](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow-probability).

## Simple Example

To first get a feel for what HMC is doing, let's start with a very simple example and visualize it. Let's define a bimodal distribution $\pi(\vec x)$ consisting of two Gaussians that are almost completely disjoint,

$$
\pi(\vec x) = \Ncal(\vec\mu_1, \mat\Sigma) + \Ncal(\vec\mu_2, \mat\Sigma)
$$

where

$$
\vec\mu_1 = (2,-2)^T,
\quad
\vec\mu_2 = (-2,2)^T,
\quad
\mat\Sigma = I_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.
$$

These sorts of distributions typically pose difficulties to MCMC algorithms since exploring them fully requires entering and passing through a region of low probability density, which by nature of the algorithm is a rare event.

Let's see how many samples HMC requires to achieve mixing, i.e. jumping from whichever mode we start sampling first to the other. Once both modes are covered with a roughly equal number of samples, we can use the generated Markov chain $\Ccal$ to compute accurate expectation values with respect to $\pi$. For example, say we have an observable $f(\vec x)$ and were interested in the value it's likely to take given the probabilities for different $\vec x$ under $\pi(\vec x)$,

$$
\expec_\pi[f] = \int_{\Rbb^2} \pi(\vec x) \, f(\vec x) \, \dif\vec x.
$$

If the Markov chain has converged, we can get an accurate estimate for this expectation value, by averaging over samples in the chain,

$$
\expec_\pi[f] \approx \hat f = \frac{1}{|\Ccal|} \sum_{\vec x \in \Ccal} f(\vec x),
$$

And here's the code to generate $\Ccal$ using TFP:

```py:title=simple-distros.py
import numpy as np
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

tfd = tfp.distributions

normals_2d = [
    tfd.MultivariateNormalDiag([2, -2], [1, 1]),
    tfd.MultivariateNormalDiag([-2, 2], [1, 1]),
]
bimodal_gauss = tfd.Mixture(tfd.Categorical([1, 1]), normals_2d)

@tf.function
def sample_chain(*args, **kwargs):
    """Since this is bulk of the computation, using @tf.function
    here to compile a static graph for tfp.mcmc.sample_chain
    significantly improves performance.
    """
    return tfp.mcmc.sample_chain(*args, **kwargs)

kernel = tfp.mcmc.NoUTurnSampler(bimodal_gauss.log_prob, step_size=1e-3)
adaptive_kernel = tfp.mcmc.DualAveragingStepSizeAdaptation(
    kernel,
    num_adaptation_steps=500,
    step_size_setter_fn=lambda pkr, new_step_size: pkr._replace(
        step_size=new_step_size
    ),
    step_size_getter_fn=lambda pkr: pkr.step_size,
    log_accept_prob_getter_fn=lambda pkr: pkr.log_accept_ratio,
)

chain, trace, final_kernel_results = sample_chain(
    kernel=adaptive_kernel,
    num_results=150,
    current_state=tf.constant([0.1, 0]),
    return_final_kernel_results=True,
)

x = np.arange(-6, 6, 0.3)
domain = np.mgrid[-6:6:0.3, -6:6:0.3].reshape(2, -1).T

fig = go.Figure(
    data=[
        go.Surface(x=x, y=x, z=bimodal_gauss.prob(domain).numpy().reshape(len(x), -1)),
        go.Scatter3d(x=chain[:, 0], y=chain[:, 1], z=bimodal_gauss.prob(chain)),
    ]
)
fig.update_layout(
    height=700, title=go.layout.Title(text=f"step size: {step_size}", xref="paper", x=0)
)
```

Note that these awkward `lambda` functions passed to `adaptive_kernel` are only necessary due to temporary inconsistencies in TFP's `mcmc` module and should become superfluous once that receives a good refactor [as promised here](https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/issues/549#issuecomment-529092462). If you're reading this post several months down the line, then probably all you'll need to write is

```py
adaptive_kernel = tfp.mcmc.DualAveragingStepSizeAdaptation(
    kernel, num_adaptation_steps=adapt_steps
)
```

The resulting plot you get should look like this.

<LazyPlot {...bimodalProps} />

_Bimodal distribution decorated by 100 HMC samples which managed to jump the gap between modes._

During the Hamiltonian evolution that's simulated to obtain each new sample in the chain $\Ccal$, the potential energy $V$ corresponds to the negative log of the probability density shown above, $V(\vec x) = -\log \pi(\vec x)$. The two peaks thus correspond to more shallow holes in the otherwise flat ground that's the arena of the Hamiltonian simulation. The starting point where the very first Hamiltonian simulation sets off is randomly initialized. It then takes a few iterations before the current head of the chain "falls" into one of the holes. Once there, Hamiltonian dynamics will likely stick there for a while and gather samples from that region of increased probability/decreased potential energy. To eventually transition between the two modes is only possible when starting out a Hamiltonian evolution with a particularly large initial momentum. The momenta are randomly sampled at the start of each new evolution, $\vec p \sim \Ncal(0, \mat\mat\Sigma)$ (independent of the current position). This ensures that lower energy points are more likely to be sampled since the Gaussian has a higher density for small values of $|\vec p|$. Only if we happen to sample a momentum that's sufficiently high (and happen to be moving in the right direction) can we overcome the potential barrier between two modes.

## HMC Routines

Now let's look at actually applying HMC to the parameters of a neural network which we assume to be Gaussian distributed. First, let's define a few functions to handle the grunt work in this exercise.

## Boston Housing

Finally, let's look at a concrete example by training a network with HMC to predict Boston housing prices and compare its performance with a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) network (i.e. just maximum likelihood with a bit of regularization due to priors). (The following is a VS Code-style Jupyter notebook, the `# %%` are cell delimiters.)

```py:title=src/notebooks/hmc/boston.py

import src.bnn.map as mapnn

# %%

(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.boston_housing.load_data()
X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = [
    arr.astype("float32") for arr in [X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test]
]

# %%
weight_prior = tfp.distributions.Normal(0, 0.2)
bias_prior = tfp.distributions.Normal(0, 0.2)
map_y_pred, map_y_var, map_log_probs, map_final_state = mapnn.map_predict(
    weight_prior, bias_prior, X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test
)

# %%
map_mae = (np.abs(map_y_pred - y_test)).mean()

# %%
hmc_y_pred, hmc_y_var, _ = hmcnn.hmc_predict(
    weight_prior, bias_prior, map_final_state, X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test
)

# %%
hmc_mae = (np.abs(hmc_y_pred - y_test)).mean()
```

## Things to look forward to

TFP is still in the process of adding more functionality to its `mcmc` module. For instance, both the [`NoUTurnSampler`](https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/blob/23573a10f203bf740e69f52387bbe8070703eda5/tensorflow_probability/python/experimental/mcmc/nuts.py#L75) and the [`DualAveragingStepSizeAdaptation`](https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/blob/23573a10f203bf740e69f52387bbe8070703eda5/tensorflow_probability/python/mcmc/dual_averaging_step_size_adaptation.py#L97) appeared only shortly before this post. They're both great improvements over the regular [`HamiltonianMonteCarlo`](https://tensorflow.org/probability/api_docs/python/tfp/mcmc/HamiltonianMonteCarlo) kernel and [`SimpleStepSizeAdaptation`](https://tensorflow.org/probability/api_docs/python/tfp/mcmc/SimpleStepSizeAdaptation), respectively. The former should allow the kernel to converge to optimal step sizes faster while the latter enables it to scale to even larger problems in terms of state space dimensionality. I, for one, am excited to see where this is headed.
