Welcome to my _new_ blog! Gone is my former WordPress site at janosh-riebesell.com. This is the first post on a new site I created myself. It's JavaScript from head to heel using the amazing site generator [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) and [`styled-components`](https://www.styled-components.com) for the design and layout. The latter relies heavily on the awesome CSS grid, by the way.

In case you're considering switching your own site to Gatsby or more generally the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org), I definitely recommend it. It was an incredibly enjoyable learning experience. Gatsby is open-source, has excellent docs and an awesome team of maintainers allowing you to contribute your own code and ideas to the project anytime you like.

At this point I've pretty much run out of things to say. And admittedly, this post is mostly for testing purposes anyway. Let's see if I'll actually find the time to put real content here. Let alone something on my mind worth writing about.
